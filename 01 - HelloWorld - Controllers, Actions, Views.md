##  1. <a name='LearningObjectives'></a>Learning Objectives
- creating ASP.NET project
- adding controllers
- working with actions that return a `string`
- working with actions that return a `View`
- communicating between the `Controller` and the `View` using the `ViewBag`
- understanding routes

##  2. <a name='Creatingtheproject'></a>Creating the project
1. Create the ASP.NET project. 
   
   To create the project, select `New > Project` from the Visual Studio `File` menu and select the `Templates > Visual C# > .NET Core` section of the `New Project` dialog window. Select the `ASP.NET Core Web Application (Model-View-Controller)` item, and enter `HelloWorld` into the Name field. Check the "Do not use top-level statements" checkbox.
2. Run the project.

##  3. <a name='Controller'></a>Controller

3. This project uses a single controller to select the views displayed to users and to receive form data. Edit the `HomeController.cs` file in the `Controllers` folder to replace the placeholder code provided by Visual Studio with the statements shown below.

    ``` c#
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public string Index()
        {
            return "Hello World!";
        }
    }
     ```
4. Run the project and check the result.

##  4. <a name='Routes'></a>Routes

MVC applications use the ASP.NET routing system, which decides how URLs map to controllers and actions. A route is a rule that is used to decide how a request is handled. 

You can request any of the following URLs, and they will be directed to the Index action on the HomeController:
    
    * /
    * /Home
    * /Home/Index

> This is a good example of benefiting from following conventions implemented by ASP.NET. In this case, the convention is that we are going to have a controller called HomeController and that this controller will be the starting point for the MVC application. The default configuration that Visual Studio creates for a new project assumes that we will follow this convention. And since we did follow the convention, we automatically
got support for the URLs in the preceding list. If we had not followed the convention, we would need to modify the configuration to point to whatever controller we had created instead. For this simple example, the default configuration is all we need.

##  5. <a name='Views-RenderingWebPages'></a>Views - Rendering Web Pages
 
The output from the current application is just the string Hello World. In order to return an HTML response to a browser request, we need a **View**.

5. Remove all the files in the `Views/Home` folder.

    > Views are stored in the `Views` folder, organized into subfolders. Views that are associated with the `Home` controller, for example, are stored in a folder called `Views/Home`. Views that are not specific to a single controller are stored in a folder called `Views/Shared`.

    > Visual Studio creates the Home and Shared folders automatically when the  Web Application template is used and puts in some placeholder views to get the project started.

6. Change the `HomeController` as follows:

    ```c#
	public class HomeController : Controller
	{
		public IActionResult Index()
		{
			return View("MyView");
		}
	}
    ```

7. Run the application and notice the error.

    > Views are stored in the `Views` folder, organized into subfolders. Views that are associated with the `Home` controller, for example, are stored in a folder called `Views/Home`. Views that are not specific to a single controller are stored in a folder called `Views/Shared`.

    > Visual Studio creates the `Home` and `Shared `folders automatically when the Web Application template is used and puts in some placeholder views to get the project started.

8. Change the `HomeController` as follows:

    ```c#
	public class HomeController : Controller
	{
		public ViewResult Index()
		{
			return View();
		}
	}
    ``` 
9. Add the `Index` view
    >Razor view files have the `.cshtml` file extension because they are a mix of `C#` code and `HTML` elements.

10. Modify the `Index` view as follows

    ```HTML
    @{
        Layout = null;
    }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Index</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            Hello World (from the view)
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
11. Run the application. The view should be displayed.

##  6. <a name='Views-AddingDynamicOutput'></a>Views - Adding Dynamic Output

> One way to pass data from the controller to the view is by using the `ViewBag` object, which is a member of the `Controller` base class. `ViewBag` is a dynamic object to which you can assign arbitrary properties, making those values available in whatever view is subsequently rendered. 

12. Modify the `HomeController` as follows.

    ```C#
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            int hour = DateTime.Now.Hour;
            ViewBag.Greeting = hour < 12 ? "Good Morning" : "Good Afternoon";
            return View();
        }
    }
    ```

13. Modify the `Index` view as follows.

    ```HTML
    @{
        Layout = null;
    }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <title>Index</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            @ViewBag.Greeting World (from the view)
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
