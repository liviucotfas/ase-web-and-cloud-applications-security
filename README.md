# Web and Cloud Applications Security

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (can be downloaded from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community ). Make sure that the "ASP.NET and web development" workload is installed, either during setup or afterwards from "Tools > Get Tools and Features".
- Note: If you are not regularly using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022, you can install it in a Virtual Machine, either on your computer or in the cloud. If you are using Windows 10/11, Hyper-V Manager offers the possibility to download a Windows 11 Virtual Machine pre-configured with Visual Studio by choosing the "Quick Create" option and selecting the "Windows 11 dev environment" image. The Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform also provides a virtual machine template that has Visual Studio installed.
